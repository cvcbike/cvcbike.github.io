Cycling is more than just a sport‚Äîit&rsquo;s a way of life. For the riders of **Cumberland Valley Collective (CVC)**, it&rsquo;s about pushing limits, celebrating the journey, and sharing unforgettable miles as a team. Whether it&rsquo;s road, gravel, cyclocross, or mountain biking, this team thrives on the thrill of racing and the camaraderie of epic rides. 

As we roll into 2025, let&rsquo;s take a moment to meet the riders and sponsors of CVC.  

## The Riders of CVC  

### Nelson Beimfohr ‚Äì Roanoke, VA (Cat 3 Road/CX)  
In 2024, Nelson was **stoked** to showcase the stunning beauty of his hometown, hosting teammates for epic events like the Appalachian Journey and Mountaineer Gravel. Next year, he&rsquo;s setting his sights on **competing in USAC XCO Nationals in Roanoke**‚Äîa big goal on home turf. When he&rsquo;s not chasing podiums, you might catch him refueling with **gummy peach rings**.  

### Jake Haines ‚Äì Harrisburg, PA (Cat 3, Full-Time Gettin&rsquo; Rad Since &rsquo;89)  
Known for curating [@pennsylvania.dirtbags](https://www.instagram.com/pennsylvania.dirtbags/) and carrying an impressive r√©sum√© (including &rsquo;08 Scholar Athlete and &rsquo;14 Mr. Pharmacy Runner-Up), Jake&rsquo;s most legendary 2024 moment? **Taking down an entire shoe fly pie on the [JORTS Route](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Paauv6M7T-M&t=127s)**. He hasn&rsquo;t locked in a 2025 goal just yet, but whatever it is, you can bet an **oatmeal double decker cream pie** (iykyk) will be involved.  

### Darin Alleman ‚Äì Fredericksburg, VA (Cat 3 Road, Cat 1 Graveler)  
Darin crushed 2024 by **winning his age group at Gravel Grinder Nationals** and conquering four **epicly brutal** rides over **150 miles or 10+ hours**. Next up? A massive test of endurance: **finishing the 250-mile Rockstar Gravel race in under 24 hours**. To fuel the grind, he sticks to the essentials: **meat sticks and Pop-Tarts**.  

### JB Haglund ‚Äì Havertown, PA (Cat 3 Road)  
JB took on the **Stone Harbor Summer Classic**, riding from Narberth, PA, all the way to the Jersey Shore. He&rsquo;s still keeping his 2025 plans under wraps, but one thing&rsquo;s for sure‚Äîhe&rsquo;ll have a **Hershey&rsquo;s Take Five** bar in his jersey pocket for the ride.  

### Noah Koppenhaver ‚Äì Shippensburg, PA (Cat 1 Road)  
Noah&rsquo;s highlight wasn&rsquo;t just about individual results‚Äîit was about **racing alongside his friends on CVC**, proving that the best victories are shared. For 2025, he has one simple but clear goal: **win a race**. His go-to gas station snack? **Rice Krispie Treats**, because even Cat 1 racers need a little sugar boost.  

### Laverne Eberly ‚Äì Shippensburg, PA (Cat 3 Road)  
Laverne made waves in 2024, **grabbing 3rd place in the Monster Cross Men&rsquo;s Open and 2nd at the Smoketown Crit**. He&rsquo;s determined to keep that momentum going by **shaking up the Cat 3 field in 2025**. And what fuels this kind of determination? A **Snickers bar**, of course.  

### John Dawes ‚Äì Chambersburg, PA (Cat 5 Road)  
John ended 2023 on a high note by **winning the Cat 5 race at the Backyard Boogie**, proving he&rsquo;s ready for bigger challenges. His 2025 goal? **a podium in the 4s**. The victory celebrations wouldn&rsquo;t be complete without a **Sheetz Funfetti doughnut**‚Äîbecause nothing says success like sprinkles.  

### Alex Wolfe Philly, PA (Mtb Cat 2, Road/CX Cat 4)  
Alex discovered a new love for cyclocross in 2024, realizing just how **rad** the discipline is. His next mission? **Podium a road race from a breakaway**‚Äîa challenge that requires tactical finesse and a serious engine. When it&rsquo;s time for a snack break, he&rsquo;s reaching for **Haribo Gummy Bears**.  

### Kyle Irwin ‚Äì Hagerstown, MD (Cat 2 Road, Cat 6 Bikepacker)  
Kyle&rsquo;s 2024 season had one standout word: **[JORTS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Paauv6M7T-M&t=127s)**. Looking ahead, he&rsquo;s setting dual goals: **podium in a 2/3 criterium and earning a Cat 3 cyclocross upgrade**. His fuel of choice? A **Reese&rsquo;s Fast Break and a roller dog**‚Äîthe perfect combo of sweet, salty, and questionable gas station cuisine.  

### Matthew Briggs ‚Äì Gaithersburg, MD (Cat 3 Road)  
Matthew had a breakthrough season, **scoring his first podium in a Cat 3 field**. For 2025, he&rsquo;s laser-focused on **securing more podiums, especially at his hometown race in Poolesville, MD**. To keep the energy high, he opts for **2-4 Sheetz hot dogs loaded with cheese and chili**‚Äîa bold choice for a bold rider.

### Andy Wolfe - Philly, PA (Cat 1 Road)
Andy Wolfe is a powerhouse on two wheels, tearing up the racing scene in Cat 1. In 2024, he put in serious miles riding the legendary JORTS route with the boys and throwing down in cyclocross alongside Alex Wolfe. Looking ahead to 2025, Andy is hyped to take on the Philadelphia Riverfront Criterium, bringing speed and grit to his home turf.  

When it comes to fueling up, he swears by one thing‚Äî**Little Debbie‚Äôs Double Decker Oatmeal Cr√®me Pie**. And yes, *it has to be the double decker*.

### The rest of the team

While some of the crew didn‚Äôt get around to sending in a full bio, they‚Äôve been out there putting in the miles, chasing breakaways, and stacking up podiums just the same. Whether it‚Äôs hammering gravel, ripping crits, or just showing up for the post-ride snacks, every rider on the squad brings something rad to the mix‚Äîso if you see them out there, give ‚Äòem a shout (or a snack).
