Cycling is more than just a sport—it’s a way of life. For the riders of **Cumberland Valley Collective (CVC)**, it’s about pushing limits, celebrating the journey, and sharing unforgettable miles as a team. Whether it’s road, gravel, cyclocross, or mountain biking, this team thrives on the thrill of racing and the camaraderie of epic rides. 

As we roll into 2025, let’s take a moment to meet the riders and sponsors of CVC.  

## The Riders of CVC  

### **Nelson Beimfohr – Roanoke, VA (Cat 3 Road/CX)**  
In 2024, Nelson was **stoked** to showcase the stunning beauty of his hometown, hosting teammates for epic events like the Appalachian Journey and Mountaineer Gravel. Next year, he’s setting his sights on **competing in USAC XCO Nationals in Roanoke**—a big goal on home turf. When he’s not chasing podiums, you might catch him refueling with **gummy peach rings**.  

### **Jake Haines – Harrisburg, PA (Cat 3, Full-Time Gettin’ Rad Since ’89)**  
Known for curating [@pennsylvania.dirtbags](https://www.instagram.com/pennsylvania.dirtbags/) and carrying an impressive résumé (including ’08 Scholar Athlete and ’14 Mr. Pharmacy Runner-Up), Jake’s most legendary 2024 moment? **Taking down an entire shoe fly pie on the [JORTS Route](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Paauv6M7T-M&t=127s)**. He hasn’t locked in a 2025 goal just yet, but whatever it is, you can bet an **oatmeal double decker cream pie** (iykyk) will be involved.  

### **Darin Alleman – Fredericksburg, VA (Cat 3 Road, Cat 1 Graveler)**  
Darin crushed 2024 by **winning his age group at Gravel Grinder Nationals** and conquering four **epicly brutal** rides over **150 miles or 10+ hours**. Next up? A massive test of endurance: **finishing the 250-mile Rockstar Gravel race in under 24 hours**. To fuel the grind, he sticks to the essentials: **meat sticks and Pop-Tarts**.  

### **JB Haglund – Havertown, PA (Cat 3 Road)**  
JB took on the **Stone Harbor Summer Classic**, riding from Narberth, PA, all the way to the Jersey Shore. He’s still keeping his 2025 plans under wraps, but one thing’s for sure—he’ll have a **Hershey’s Take Five** bar in his jersey pocket for the ride.  

### **Noah Koppenhaver – Shippensburg, PA (Cat 1 Road)**  
Noah’s highlight wasn’t just about individual results—it was about **racing alongside his friends on CVC**, proving that the best victories are shared. For 2025, he has one simple but clear goal: **win a race**. His go-to gas station snack? **Rice Krispie Treats**, because even Cat 1 racers need a little sugar boost.  

### **Laverne Eberly – Shippensburg, PA (Cat 3 Road)**  
Laverne made waves in 2024, **grabbing 3rd place in the Monster Cross Men’s Open and 2nd at the Smoketown Crit**. He’s determined to keep that momentum going by **shaking up the Cat 3 field in 2025**. And what fuels this kind of determination? A **Snickers bar**, of course.  

### **John Dawes – Chambersburg, PA (Cat 5 Road)**  
John ended 2023 on a high note by **winning the Cat 5 race at the Backyard Boogie**, proving he’s ready for bigger challenges. His 2025 goal? **Earn a Cat 4 upgrade**. The victory celebrations wouldn’t be complete without a **Sheetz Funfetti doughnut**—because nothing says success like sprinkles.  

### **Alexander Wolfe (Category Not Listed)**  
Alexander discovered a new love for cyclocross in 2024, realizing just how **rad** the discipline is. His next mission? **Podium a road race from a breakaway**—a challenge that requires tactical finesse and a serious engine. When it’s time for a snack break, he’s reaching for **Haribo Gummy Bears**.  

### **Kyle Irwin – Hagerstown, MD (Cat 2 Road, Cat 6 Bikepacker)**  
Kyle’s 2024 season had one standout word: **JORTS**. Looking ahead, he’s setting dual goals: **podium in a 2/3 criterium and earn a Cat 3 cyclocross upgrade**. His fuel of choice? A **Reese’s Fast Break and roller dogs**—the perfect combo of sweet, salty, and questionable gas station cuisine.  

### **Matthew Briggs – Gaithersburg, MD (Cat 3 Road)**  
Matthew had a breakthrough season, **scoring his first podium in a Cat 3 field**. For 2025, he’s laser-focused on **securing more podiums, especially at his hometown race in Poolesville, MD**. To keep the energy high, he opts for **2-4 Sheetz hot dogs loaded with cheese and chili**—a bold choice for a bold rider.  

## **Rolling into 2025**  

The Cumberland Valley Collective isn’t just about racing—it’s about the shared experience of pushing limits, embracing challenges, and having a damn good time on two wheels. As the team gears up for another exciting season, there’s no doubt they’ll be tackling everything from **grueling gravel epics to high-speed crit battles**—all powered by sheer determination (and maybe a few too many gas station snacks).  

Want to follow along? Keep up with the team on social media and at local races throughout the year. Who knows—maybe you’ll spot a CVC rider mid-breakaway, fueled by nothing but grit and a pocket full of gummy bears.  

Here’s to an incredible 2025 season—**see you out on the road!** 🚴‍♂️
